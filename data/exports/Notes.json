Unfortunately, this piece is not for us. We tend to prefer stories with more dramatic tension and more fully developed characters. This is more of anecdote. It needs more substance to carry the narrative, such as more demonstrated tension and conflict between the father and son and clarification about their relationship. \n\nGood luck with this one elsewhere. Feel free to try us again in the future with something new, but please wait at least one month before submitting again. \n\nSincerely, \nThe Editors \nBartleby Snopes \nwww.bartlebysnopes.com\n\nYou can go here to view the submission:\nhttp://bartlebysnopes.submittable.com/user/submissions/3860190",

      "note": "We think the three poets we've had the pleasure of featuring all know how to make a damn good sandwich, different in their own way, but with a common attraction to every day life and its whimsy, sometimes tragedy, despair, hope. They've set out on the journey to, in the words of Raymond Carver, \"endow those things--a chair, a window curtain, a fork, a stone, a woman's earring--with immense, even startling power.\"\n\nWe came upon one of Thomas Jay Rush's short stories in which the unlikely word \"peas\" (empowered by just the right punctuation) gave this startling effect. His poems deal similarly with everyday things and feelings in a language that is non-ornamental but that still (maybe because of this) direct our attention elsewhere, outside the poem, toward some mystery or other.\n\nhttp://kitchenpoet.blogspot.com/2011_01_01_archive.html",
