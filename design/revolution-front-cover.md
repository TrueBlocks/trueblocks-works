# You Say You Want a Revolution — Front Cover Specification

## Image Description

A single lighthouse stands on a small rocky island, its beam cutting through dense fog over an empty sea. The lighthouse is white with a warm golden light emanating from its lantern room. The surrounding atmosphere is misty blue-gray, with the water below showing subtle lavender-pink tones. The sky blends seamlessly into the fog, creating an ethereal, contemplative mood.

The composition is minimal and centered — just the lighthouse, the rocks, the sea, and the mist. No boats, no people, no other structures. The isolation is the point.

**Symbolic meaning:** "Maintaining a signal of truth when no one is watching" — the lighthouse continues its work regardless of whether ships are coming. It represents the essays' themes of persistence, integrity, and quiet resistance against a sea of noise.
